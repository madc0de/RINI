# RINI

RINI is an extremely simple and easy to understand skeleton PHP application, reduced to the max.
It's a fork of non-professional framework called MINI3 and does not come with all the stuff real frameworks have.
If you just want to show some pages, do a few database calls and a little-bit of AJAX here and there, without reading in massive documentations of highly complex professional frameworks, then RINI might be very useful for you.
RINI is easy to install, runs nearly everywhere and doesn't make things more complicated than necessary.


[MINI](https://github.com/panique/mini) (original version), [MINI2](https://github.com/panique/mini2) (used Slim router) and [MINI3](https://github.com/panique/mini3) were built by [panique](https://github.com/panique), RINI is an excellent and improved version of the original MINI3, made by [Madc0de](https://github.com/Madc0de).
